# Qiskit-TFIM
Exact simulation of 1D Transverse Field Ising Model (TFIM) using Qiskit.

## Key points
- **Exact Method**: Uses Statevector evolution (No Trotter errors).
- **Noise-Free**: Theoretical baseline for quantum dynamics.

## Acknowledgments
This project was developed with the assistance of **AI tools (Gemini)** for code optimization and formatting. The physics logic follows standard **Qiskit SDK** patterns.
